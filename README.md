# Connect-a-Chatbot-with-Lambda
A banking chatbot built with Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda. The bot handles user queries, like checking account balances, by using custom slots for account details and integrating Lambda for dynamic responses. This project demonstrates chatbot development, slot configuration, and serverless function integration.
