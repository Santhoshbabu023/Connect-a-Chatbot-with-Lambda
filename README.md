# Connect-a-Chatbot-with-Lambda
A banking chatbot built with Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda. The bot handles user queries, like checking account balances, by using custom slots for account details and integrating Lambda for dynamic responses. This project demonstrates chatbot development, slot configuration, and serverless function integration.

BankerBot - A Banking Chatbot with Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda

## Features:
- **Amazon Lex Integration**: The bot is powered by Amazon Lex, capable of processing natural language inputs from users.
- **Custom Slots**: Custom slots are used to capture specific account details (e.g., account type, balance) during conversations.
- **AWS Lambda Function**: AWS Lambda handles the logic of generating a random balance and simulating banking operations.
- **Fallback Intent**: Provides helpful fallback responses for unrecognized or invalid user inputs.
- **Code Hooks**: Lambda functions are triggered during the conversation to process user requests dynamically.

## Technologies Used:
- **Amazon Lex**: A fully managed service to create conversational interfaces using voice and text.
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless computing service that allows running code without managing servers.
- **AWS Console**: To configure the Lex bot, Lambda functions, and other AWS resources.
- **Python**: The Lambda function code is written in Python to process the requests and responses.

## Setup and Configuration:
1. **Create a new Lex bot** using the AWS Console.
2. **Define intents** and configure **custom slots** for user inputs (e.g., account type).
3. **Write a Lambda function** in Python to handle the logic for processing account balances.
4. **Connect the Lambda function** to the Lex bot using **code hooks**.
5. **Test the bot** by simulating user queries (e.g., checking balance for specific account types).

## Future Improvements:
- Integrate real data for account balances from a database.
- Add more intents for different banking operations like transferring funds.
- Improve natural language understanding with more sophisticated user input processing.

### Notes:
This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including a clear description of the technologies used, setup instructions, and how to test and deploy the chatbot. It offers an excellent guide for anyone looking to implement similar projects using AWS services.
